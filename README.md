# Let's Talk About It

An application that connects users to one person each day that is experiencing similar struggles as them. The idea is that both parties can benefit from talking through what is bothering them with someone who might have a better understanding of what they are going through. 

This was started at WicHacks 2022, but didn't really leave the design phase within the time contraints of the hackathon. I plan to actually implement this at some point!
